## PROJECT ROADMAP

- Design and implement a minimal `Model` class for a stopwatch.
- Design a _basic looking_ `GUI`.
- Connect the `model` with `GUI events`.
- `Test` GUI for _complete stopwatch functionality_ (modify or fix `model` if necessary).
- Once the stopwatch GUI is _fully functional_, streamline and improve the GUI.
- Make a **short video** _showing key functionality_ of the stopwatch `GUI` and upload to `GitHub`.
- Done!
